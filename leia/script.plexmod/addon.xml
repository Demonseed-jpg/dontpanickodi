- Possibly fix rare traceback when closing an episodes window while waiting for an episode reload task
- Fix: Core: only stop playback on screensaver if player is playing video (not audio, ...)

- Use extended title for subtitles (and add advanced/addon setting)
- Add: Show buffer state in stream info
- Reduce dialog flickering in certain situations (not fully, probably impossible)
- Player: bingeMode/autoskip credits/manual-next: avoid double-next in certain circumstances

- Hubs: make all TV/movie hubs as hub types that receive updates after items being watched or marked (un) watched
- Settings: Disable alternative home hubs refresh by default
- ServerList: further hardening, list shouldn't visually "crash" anymore in certain conditions
- Pagination/Episodes: allow right round-robin on paginated long item lists (>26)
- Movies: Reorder Cast/Related/Extras according to PlexWeb
- Movies: Add reviews
- Cast: Increase Cast picture quality everywhere
- Core/Settings: Adjust recommended cache/buffer/readfactor values for different Kodi versions, starting with 21.0-BETA2 (20.90.821)
- Core/Settings: Incorporate new Kodi cache/readfactor values; clamp cache values to divisible by 16
- Serverlist: allow roundrobin at the bottom boundary
- StreamInfo: hide OSD after closing streaminfo
- Settings: Add setting to use Kodi keyboard for searching (default: off)
